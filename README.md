## Saving Game Information
# ***Description*** - 
## My project is a simple program that uses the powers of JSON PowerDB to create a record in a database.In this we simply take the game with all of it's information like name,genre (shooting,action,adventure etc) and it's release date to save it in our database so that we can fetch particular information about that game whenever we want this will help us to understand what we like and what game should we buy for playing. I have used netbeans with HTML5/JS combined with JSON  PowerDB. JSON PowerDB is a very flexible and easy to use database
