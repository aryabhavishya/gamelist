## ***Description*** - My project is a simple program that uses the powers of JSON PowerDB to create a record in a database.In this we simply take the game name and game type along with the likes to determine that how we can rate the game according to users.Suppose if a game gains 7 "Yes" and 3 "No's" then we can keep that game apart and we can rate that game a bit higher so that If anyone is searching for that specific game then he/she can see the rating and then he can decide that whether he/she wants to play it or not. I have used HTML5/JS along with JSON PowerDB 

## ***Benefits of using JsonPowerDB*** - There are many benefits however some of them are:-
##                                    1) It is schema free
##                                    2) It is simple to use and nimble
##                                    3) It is a Real Time DBMS
##                                    4) It is a multi mode DBMS
##                                    5) It has multiple security layers
##                                    6) It is server side native SQL

## ***Release History*** - My code was published on github on 26 June 2022
